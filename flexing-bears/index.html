                    during the night and they can live between 20 to 30 years. The oldest rescued bear, Lady M, passed away at the age of 43 in a bear sanctuary in Ukraine. The
                    brown bear is the largest predator still living on the continent of Europe and the second largest in North America, followed by the black bear.
